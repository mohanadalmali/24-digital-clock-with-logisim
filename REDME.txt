program logisim evolution
In this project, a digital clock that works in 24-hour format was designed. The design of the clock is modular 
using counters, D flip-flops, multiplexers, splitters and logic gates. 
has been carried out. A 7-segment hex digital display is used for the digital display of the time.
Components Used

 Mode 10 Counter (0-9): To count units of minutes and seconds.
 Mode 6 Counter (0-5): To count minutes and seconds tens digit.
 Mode 3 Counter (0-2): To count ten digits of the hour.
 Mode 24 Counter (0-23): Multiplexer and logic counter to ensure the general operation of the clock. 
It was designed using doors.
 D Flip-Flops: To store data and enable counters to operate.
 Multiplexer: To select and route various inputs in the Mode 24 counter.
 Splitters: To split and distribute signals between modules.
 Logic Gates (AND, OR, NOT, etc.): Correct control of counters and other components. 
was used to make it work.
 Hex Digital Display: To display the time digitally.
 Clock: To synchronize the entire system.
System Design and Operation
 Seconds Counter: Seconds are counted using the Mode 10 and Mode 6 counters. of seconds 
The ones digit is managed by Mode 10 counter, and the tens digit is managed by Mode 6 counter.
 Minute Counter: Minute units and tens digits are also displayed with Mode 10 and Mode 6 counters. 
sort of.
 Hour Counter: Hours are managed by the Mode 24 counter. Multiplexer in the design of this meter 
and logic gates were used. The units digit of the clock is Mode 10, and the tens digit is Mode 3. 
It is counted with the counter.
 D Flip-Flops: Keeping the data at the output of each counter and transferring it to the next clock signal. 
It is used to preserve.
 Multiplexer: For selection and routing of different inputs in the Mode 24 counter 
used.
 Splitters: To divide signals and direct them to appropriate meters and displays. 
used.
 Logic Gates: Resetting counters, controlling overflow situations and other control 
used for operations.

 Clock Signal: All counters and D flip-flops are synchronized with the main clock signal. 
This clock signal serves the basic timing function to count seconds.
Display and Usage
Hex digital display is used to visually display counted values. Each segment, 
is updated based on the output of the relevant mode counter, ensuring accurate hours, minutes and 
seconds information is displayed on the digital screen.
Conclusion
This project includes modular counters, D flip-flops, multiplexers, splitters and logic gates. 
How to design a digital clock that works in 24-hour format using 
shows. Accurate time measurement by synchronizing the clock with a reliable clock signal 
and is presented visually to the user with a hex digital display.
